## intro

code is a mess

discord bot which allows you to track the latest spotify releases of artists

look at `handlers/commands.go` to see what this bot can do

also, abusing spotify thanks to [spotify-dl](https://github.com/GuillemCastro/spotify-dl) (read the code, won't get into the details of this one)

## quick start

fill in your `.env` files for the db and the app with what you need (discord & spotify tokens are needed)
use the makefile to start the whole thing
add your bot to your server and start using it (:


## what else?

*will probably do proper documentation "soon"TM*

if you fill like helping, you can reach out to me for the current prioritized backlog items
you can also propose anything that you feel could be interesting
